## Background

Renzon Cruz is a seasoned Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) professional with **8 years of experience** investigating complex cyber intrusions across enterprise environments. He currently serves as **Technical Director of Incident Response at Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks**, where he leads high-profile breach investigations and threat actor negotiation.

Prior to Unit 42, Renzon was a **Senior Consultant at the National Cybersecurity Agency**, where he responded to nation-state and advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns targeting critical infrastructure.

## Community Contributions

Renzon is an active contributor to the DFIR community:

- **DFIR Analyst/Contributor** at [The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) — providing detailed intrusion analysis write-ups used by defenders worldwide
- **CFP Board & APT Labs Contributor** at [Xintra APT Labs](https://www.xintra.org/) — developing hands-on APT investigation training scenarios
- **Co-Founder/Lead Instructor** at [GuideM] — lead author of Cyber Defense & Threat Hunting, and Digital Forensics & Memory Analysis courses. 

## Why IRFlow Timeline?

If you’re a DFIR analyst running macOS, you know the struggle of booting up a Windows VM just to triage a timeline. I got tired of it, so I built a solution.

Introducing **IRFlow Timeline**.

This isn't just another personal project; it’s a tool built from the ground up based on real-world IR experience. Every feature exists because I reached for it during an actual case and it wasn’t there. 

If you need to stay agile in the field without leaving your native OS, this is for you.

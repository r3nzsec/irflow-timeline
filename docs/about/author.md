## Why IRFlow Timeline?

> Born out of pure frustration with Windows-only forensic tools, so I'm about to release this personal project for DFIR analysts running macOS as their main daily driver. And for incident responders who need to triage timelines in the field without booting up a Windows VM. IRFlow Timeline was built from real-world IR experience — every feature exists because I needed it during an actual case. This tool reflects the workflows that DFIR practitioners use every day.

## Why IRFlow Timeline?

> After years of investigating breaches involving 30–50GB+ super-timelines, I needed a tool that could handle the scale of modern investigations without the overhead of enterprise SIEM infrastructure. IRFlow Timeline was built from real-world IR experience — every feature exists because I needed it during an actual case. From reconstructing ransomware kill chains to tracing lateral movement across hundreds of endpoints, this tool reflects the workflows that DFIR practitioners use every day.
